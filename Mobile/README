Use Grunt to build
Grunt relies on node and npm
	Install node
	On linux: # sudo apt-get install node

	Install grunt command line interface
	# npm install -g grunt-cli

In the Mobile directory, you can install grunt dependencies found in package.json by
# npm install

Grunt files:
Gruntfile.js
package.json

To build evernym-channels.min.js and the associated map file:
grunt uglify

To have grunt automatically build the minified file whenever a .js file in the www directory or below changes:
grunt watch

To start a web server on port 8000 to test the app locally:
grunt connect:server:keepalive
